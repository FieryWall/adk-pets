Here's my advice: 1) Rest the dog immediately - no more fetch or strenuous activity. 2) Examine the leg gently for pain points, cuts, or foreign objects in paw pads. 3) Apply cold compress for 10-15 minutes if there's soft tissue swelling. 4) Monitor for improvement over 24-48 hours. 5) See a veterinarian if the limp persists, worsens, or if you notice significant pain, as it could be a ligament strain or minor fracture requiring professional assessment. Never give human pain medications as they're toxic to dogs."

The begging behavior is common but doesn't indicate hunger - Maine Coons are food-motivated. Stick to your schedule, measure portions according to food package guidelines based on weight, and avoid free-feeding. If begging persists, consider puzzle feeders to make meals more engaging, or split the daily portion into smaller, more frequent meals (3x daily). Ensure fresh water is always available."

Since drinking and walking are normal, it's less likely to be severe dehydration or complete illness. Try these steps: 1) Offer different foods - wet food, boiled chicken and rice, or warming the food slightly. 2) Check for dental pain by gently examining teeth/gums. 3) Monitor for other symptoms like vomiting, lethargy, or behavior changes. 4) See your veterinarian within 24 hours if he still won't eat, as senior dogs need consistent nutrition and prolonged appetite loss can indicate underlying health issues."

Hiding more and showing less interest in toys can be signs that something isn't quite right, even if they're still eating well.\n\nHere are a few things that could be going on and what you can do:\n\nStress or Anxiety: Cats are sensitive creatures, and changes in their environment or routine can cause stress. Think about any recent changes in your household – a new pet, a new person, moving furniture, or even loud noises.\nPain or Discomfort: Sometimes, subtle changes in behavior like hiding can be an early indicator of pain or discomfort, especially if it's related to age or an underlying health issue.\nBoredom or Lack of Stimulation: While less likely if they're hiding, sometimes a cat might withdraw if they're not getting enough mental or physical stimulation.\nUnderlying Health Issues: Even if eating is normal, other health problems can manifest as changes in behavior.\nWhat you can do:\n\nObserve Closely: Try to note down any other subtle changes. Are they grooming differently? Are they vocalizing more or less? Are they using their litter box normally? Any changes in posture or how they move?\nCreate a Safe Space: Ensure your cat has a quiet, comfortable place where they can retreat and feel secure. This might be a cozy bed, a high shelf, or a room they can access easily.\nGentle Interaction: Don't force interaction. Let your cat come to you when they're ready. You can try offering gentle pets or sitting quietly in the same room.\nEnrichment: Even if they're not playing much now, try offering a few new toys or a puzzle feeder. Sometimes, a change in novelty can spark interest.\nCheck for Environmental Stressors: Look around your home for anything that might be upsetting your cat.\nWhen to Contact Your Veterinarian:\n\nWhile it's good to observe, persistent hiding and a significant decrease in interest in play, even with normal eating, are definitely worth a chat with your veterinarian. They can perform a thorough physical examination to rule out any pain, discomfort, or underlying health issues. They can also offer tailored advice based on your cat's specific situation.\n\nIt's always best to err on the side of caution when your pet's behavior changes. Your vet is your best resource for ensuring your tabby stays happy and healthy!"
