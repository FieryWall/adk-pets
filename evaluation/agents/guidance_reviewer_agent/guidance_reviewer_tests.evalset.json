If limping persists beyond 48 hours, worsens, or other symptoms develop (loss of appetite, lethargy, swelling), contact your veterinarian immediately. Avoid giving human pain medications as they can be toxic to dogs."

Maine Coons are prone to overeating, so measure portions and avoid free-feeding. If begging between meals, consider dividing daily food into 3 smaller portions or adding a small amount of wet food for satiety. Monitor weight regularly and adjust portions as needed. Fresh water should always be available."
